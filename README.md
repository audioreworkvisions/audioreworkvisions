## Setting Up the Backend Service

To securely store and access the OpenAI API key, follow these steps to set up the backend service:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/audioreworkvisions/audioreworkvisions.git
cd audioreworkvisions
```

### 2. Navigate to the Backend Directory

```sh
cd backend
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 5. Start the Backend Server

Run the following command to start the backend server:

```sh
node server.js
```

The backend server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 6. Update Frontend Code

Ensure that the frontend code in `index.html` is updated to make API calls to the backend service for OpenAI API requests.
